This tutorial demonstrates how to generate random numbers in an HLS component by using the random number generator class that is provided with the Intel HLS Compiler.

The HLS/rand_lib.h header file supports two different classes of random number generator: Uniform and Gaussian.
The uniform random number generator class generates random numbers from a uniform distribution of numbers, 
while the Gaussian random number generator class generates random numbers from a Gaussian (or normal) distribution of numbers.
 
To generate random numbers in your component, declare an instance of either the `RNG_Uniform` or `RNG_Gaussian` class. 

When you declare the random number generator object as `static`, each invocation of the component continues the random sequence.
If you do not declare the random number generator object as `static`, the sequence restarts each time the component is invoked. 


This tutorial requires the following tools to be installed:
  - Intel HLS Compiler
  - ModelSim

To run this tutorial:
  - On Linux run "make"
