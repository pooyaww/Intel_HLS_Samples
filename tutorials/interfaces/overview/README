When optimizing a design, not only changing the algorithm might help, but also
choosing the right interface can effectively improve the QoR. However, sometimes
the system that a component will be added to dictates what interfaces must be
used.  This tutorial uses vector addition as an example and demonstrates how
choosing different interfaces can impact the QoR of a component without changing
the algorithm. 

This tutorial contains 5 parts, part_1_pointer, part_2_mm_master,
part_3_mm_slave, part_4_stream, and part_5_pass_by_value, where each part uses a
different interafce type.

After running the tutorial, review each area report for the different parts of
the tutorial and observe how the area estimate changes across the different
interface types. 

Depending on your design constraints, you might need to experiment and find the
interface that is applicable and best-suited for your design. 

For more details and explanation of implications of choosing different
interfaces, see "Choosing the Best Interface for Your Component" in the Intel
