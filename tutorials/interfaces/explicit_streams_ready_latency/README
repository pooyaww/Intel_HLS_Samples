This tutorial shows the advantage of using the readyLatency parameter with
stream writes to achieve a better loop initiation interval (II).  This
tutorial consists of two parts, which are best observed in order.

transmit.cpp 
In this tutorial, assume that streams A and B are trying to send the result of
multiplying data from each of their streams to stream C. Stream C writes data 
using the following rules: 
1) Steam C can write the next result only after it has an acknowledge of
   the previous result. 
2) If the acknowledge of the result fails, stream C makes up to 3 reattempts to
   write the data again.
   - If all the reattempts of any result fail, the program assumes
     something is wrong with stream C and times out.  
The High Level Design Reports show that the component has an II of 3.

transmit_ready_latency.cpp 
The functionality of this design is identical to that of transmit.cpp, except
that the stream C has a readyLatency value of 3. The High Level Design Reports
show that the component has an II of 1.  

The II issues of transmit.cpp are fixed in transmit_ready_latency.cpp by using
readyLatency because readyLatency can be used to change the distance between
the check of ready (the success return) and the write. That is, the component
can start the next iteration of the loop before the value to be written to the
stream is computed. This can be illustrated through the following diagram:
