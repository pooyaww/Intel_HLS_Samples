This design example demonstrates various use cases of ac_int as well as a few
cases where you can achieve a higher QoR by using minor variations in coding style.
For more information, see "Arbitrary Precision Math Support" in the Intel High Level Synthesis Compiler Reference Manual.
In this example, ref/ac_fixed.h has been included to utilize Calypto `ac_fixed` when we compile the code with native compiler, for example g++.
